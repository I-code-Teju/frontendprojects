## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex


### What I learned
<html>
<p>
While making this project, I learnt a couple of ways on how to use flex better. I am happy I took on this challenge because it changed my perspective on writing codes. I failed a couple of times but Got back up.

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

- My knowledge on CSS Grids has to be refined.
- I want more challenges that takes me out of my zone.
- My application of css was topnotch


### Useful resources

- [Google Fonts](https://www.googlefonts.com) - This helped me for the font i desired. I really like their interface and easy import and will use it going forward.
