### What I learned
<html>
<p>
While making this project, I learnt a couple of ways on how to use flex better. I am happy I took on this challenge because it changed my perspective on writing codes. I failed a couple of times but Got back up.

### Continued development

- My knowledge on CSS Grids has to be refined.

- My application of css was topnotch


### Useful resources
